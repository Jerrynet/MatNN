{"name":"MatNN","tagline":"An Neural Network framework for MATLAB","body":"# MatNN: An NN framework for MATLAB\r\n\r\n**MatNN** is a MATLAB framework for neural network training and testing. It aims to provide the similarity of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org), and elastic workflow of [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet).\r\n\r\nThis toolbox requires [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to be installed in your system and added to your MATLAB path.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n**MatNN** provides some features you may familiar with Caffe or other CNN tools:\r\n- Weight Sharing\r\n- Multiple Losses\r\n- Custom data sampling algorithm\r\n- Custom layer with custom parameters/weights/loss/...\r\n- Multiple GPUs support\r\n\r\nNote that we don't provide data layers, you should design your data sampling and fetching routines.\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\n**MatNN** uses the CUDA/C++ code from [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet)\r\nto make your training progress more efficient, and the entire framework is built on top of [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet).\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\n- ***Minimal reuqirement of external libraries.*** We will provide a pure matlab code version and a matlab+cuda kernel version, so your code is portable (no need to compile external libraries). And also include the basic version based on MatConvNet. Because you can easily customize a layer, so any exists libraries, like CUDA/cuBlas/cuDNN can be added to your workflow if you want. A cuBlas/cuDNN version will be considered after this project is out of beta. Note that even the pure matlab version will have GPU support from parallel computing toolbox of Matlab.\r\n- ***Provide the elastic workflow and maintain the computation efficiency.*** We will separate each core functions into modules so that you can do less work to make them fit your need.\r\n- ***Test your ideas and validate them quickly.*** Although learning other tools/programming languages may not be a problem, use you exists matlab code with MatNN is time reserved compared to learn a new language. We provide familiar definition of Caffe, if you have learned it, then you can get started quickly.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: **Parallel computing toolbox** for Matlab\r\n\r\n1. Download source code\r\n2. Install [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet), and set matlab path\r\n2. (optional) use NVCC to compile .cu code into .ptx\r\n3. Done!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n**MatNN** is under the Simplified BSD License.\r\nIf you use **MatNN** in your work, please refer to the homepage of this project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

# MatNN - An Neural Network Framework for MATLAB

**MatNN** is a MATLAB framework for neural network training and testing. It aims to provide the similarity of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org), and elastic workflow of [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet).

This toolbox requires [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to be installed in your system and added to your MATLAB path.

## Features

**MatNN** provides some features you may familiar with [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) or other CNN tools:
+ Weight Sharing
+ Multiple Losses
+ Custom data sampling algorithm
+ Custom layer with custom parameters/weights/loss/...
+ Multiple GPUs support
